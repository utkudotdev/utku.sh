During my time at the AIRLab, I worked on urgency-aware navigation for hospital robots. Hospitals, especially ERs, can be chaotic environments and difficult for robots to navigate. Furthermore, many tasks in the ER are time-critical; a robot failing to navigate properly and blocking doctors and nurses can cost lives, even if the robot's task is not critical. To help solve this problem, I worked on software packages that aid in "urgency-aware" navigation, where the robot is able to effectively determine the urgency of people around it and give way where necessary. I built modules that tracked people in 3D space, determined an urgency score based on their motion, and planned paths around static obstacles and humans.
